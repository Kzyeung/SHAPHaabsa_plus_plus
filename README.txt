All software is written in Python 3.6.8. 

Code is partially written by Maria Trusca and Vlad Miron:

First, the following code has to be run
1. create_embeddings.py to generate embeddings using the uncased BERT base model.
2. main.py to train and test the model, which will result in a graph of the model that we can use to make new predictions.

Using the graph of the model, SHAP model 1 and SHAP model 2 can be run through Jupyter.
